# XIME Input Method Editor
### - Yet another Rime Frontend on Mac OS X

***XIME is still under heavy development and has not fully implemented the following features, and even may completely not work at all. Please fell free to contribute to the project and join our discussion.***

* Use [Rime][1] as backend, extremely fast and flexible.
* Inspired by [Squirrel][2], but completely rewritten.
* Integrated GUI customizer, it has never been so easy and joyful to customize your IME.
* Carefully redesigned user experience that suits your OS X harmouniously.
* Easy to install, easy to remove.
* Sync your preferences and dictionary via Dropbox.

If you have any other idea, please let us know in the issue tracker.
